## Generate Angular components

To generate a components named "problem-list" under `src/app/components` directory:

`ng g c problem-list`
`g` stands for generate; `c` is for component.
`it`: inline template; `is`: inline style, no css file generated

It creates four files:
* x.component.css   -- Style
* x.component.html  -- View
* x.component.spec.ts   -- Test
* x.component.ts -- Control

and updates `app.module.ts`, which is in bootfile because in `main.ts`, `bootstrape(app.module)` specifies that the bootfile is `app.module`.

All Angular componets must be added into `declaration` list of app.modules.ts if it wants to be loaded.

Now let's take a look at the new component.ts file:
each component has
1. selector - 
2. templateUrl
3. styleUrl

```typescript
Component({
  selector: 'app-problem-list',
  templateUrl: './problem-list.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./problem-list.component.css']
})
```

Put problem list selector into `app.compoennet.html`:

```html
<app-problem-list><app-problem-list/>
```

## Create a data structure (the problem schema)

Create a folder `data-structure` and create `problem.ts`

In this ts file, define problem schema:
```typescript
export class Problem {
    id: number;
    name: string;
    desc: string;
    difficulty: string;
}
```

## Add a var in class

Go to `problem-list.component.ts`, import { Problem}  from `problem.ts`. Create a Problem[] array
```typescript
export class ProblemListComponent implements OnInit {
  problems: Problem[];
  ...
```
## Create some dummy data

Create a file containing dummy data: an array which contains five problems. Call it `mock-problems.ts`.
```typescript
import { Problem } from './data-structure/problem';
export const PROBLEMS: Problem[] = [
  {
    id: 1,
    name: "Two Sum",
    desc: 
	
	...
    id: 5,
	name: "..."
	desc: `Given an array of n integer with duplicate number, and a moving window(size k), move the window at each iteration from the start of the array, find the maximum number inside the window at each moving.`,
    difficulty: "super"
  }
];
```

## View: create a list

We want to create a table format list. let's go to boostrap and copy a list-group component.

```html
<div class="container">
  <div class="list-group">
    <a class="list-group-item" >
		Cras justo odio
    </a>
  </div>
</div>
```
## What does `export` mean? 
If you others need to call a class in a call, you need to export the class.
Other files can call data in another file. if you don't want a file content to be used, just do not write export, then external files cannot import its data.

## use {{ }} to call params in javascript file.
For example, {{problem.difficulty}}


## `ngFor`: render item in a list/array
`ngFor` is Angular's for loop. It trasverses each item in an array. 
The syntax is:
`*ngFor = "let problem of problems"` problem is the self-defined name to present each item in this array.
`problem.desc` is the description value of a problem.

This gets every item in problem array. if you print `problem.id`, it gives you their id one by one.`problem.desc` is the description value of a problem.

#add styles to the list
I do not show css here. Just import and copy some from bootstrap.
'pull-left label difficulty diff-' + easy or medium or hard is a data-binding (due to Angular)

```html
<div class="container">
  <div class="list-group">
    <a class="list-group-item" *ngFor="let problem of problems">
      <span class="{{'pull-left label difficulty diff-' + problem.difficulty.toLocaleLowerCase()}}">
        {{problem.difficulty}}
      </span>
      <strong class="title">{{problem.id}}. {{problem.name}}</strong>
    </a>
  </div>
</div>

```



## install and add bootstrap

1. add with CDN
 
To use CDN link, add the link address to `index.html`. Be careful, a production project should not use CDN links as the link may become invalid.

2. or `npm install bootsrap@3 --save`
with `--save`, you can add this dependency to package.json


Boostrap uses jQuery to support animation. we need to `npm install jquery`.


3. add bootstrap and jquery to stypes and script.
* Open file: `/angular-cli.json`

* Add css file to styles[]
```ts
      "styles": [
        "styles.css",
        "../node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"
      ],
```
* Add javascript files to script[]

```ts
      "scripts": [
        "../node_modules/jquery/dist/jquery.js",
        "../node_modules/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.js"
      ],
```
jquery must be located before bootstrap as it is bootstrap's dependency.



## Run serve

`ng serve`
`ng serve` === `npm start`, refer to package.json
```json
  "scripts": {
    "ng": "ng",
    "start": "ng serve",
    "build": "ng build",
    "test": "ng test",
    "lint": "ng lint",
    "e2e": "ng e2e"
  },
```
